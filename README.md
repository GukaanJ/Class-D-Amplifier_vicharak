# Class-D-Amplifier_vicharak
This repository contains the complete design, simulation files, and documentation for a Class-D audio power amplifier implemented and tested using Proteus CADCAM. The project demonstrates PWM-based audio amplification using an op-amp comparator, MOSFET half-bridge switching stage, and LC output filter.
